    "story": "My uncle, an upstanding man when sober, transformed into a monster under the influence of alcohol. His raging alcoholic tendencies led to severe abuse of his children, including horrifying acts such as threatening to dip their heads in the toilet bowl. Although my auntie ultimately divorced him, the scars of his actions left a lasting trauma on my cousins. One of them never recovered from the pain, ending up in prison where he eventually lost his life. This story is a stark testament to the destructive power of alcohol, not only affecting the individual but tearing families apart."
